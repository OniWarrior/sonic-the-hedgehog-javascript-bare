# sonic-the-hedgehog-javascript-bare
This is my new version of my attempt to create sonic the hedgehog from javascript,html, and css 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Personnel
#--------------------------------------------------------------------
The only engineer working on this will be me.

# Purpose
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
To push my current skills further by creating from scratch
a recreation of one, fully complete, level of Sonic the Hedgehog along with
a title screen, and a fictitious game development studio landing page.

# Technologies
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is going to be no frills
1. Vanilla Javascript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. GIMP

# Note:
 I'm only going to use the bare minimum. If I happen to need a particular tool
 or technology I will list it.
 
 I will also make a technical document that also lists any other assets I used.
